1) we saw how we can write a hello world program using just html
2) then in js
3) after that we saw how to bring react into our code i:e cdn links
***what is the react element? => its a object 
***createElement takes 3 arguments "the name of the tag" {and the attributes} and [ last one is childrens if its more than one than we use an array]
***this object using reactDOM.createRoot this createRoot is resposible to assign a root
inside react and when we do root.render this render method helps us to put object to 
our page... ReactElement(Object) => HTML(Browser Understand)
*** if we pass in id root(in html page) something like h2 or p tag that is going to replaced by render method
and if something that is not inside in out root id its going to remain same as it is so that means
we can use react any part or small part like nav or sidebar and the whole page remains as it is that why its called a library */
